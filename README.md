# VetsforPets
## What is it?
This project is called vetsForPets and its main goal is to be a platform where vets can make home appointments and earn some extra money. This project was done for third module at Ironhack bootcamp. 

## Main funcitons
This app has only the clients views for the moment
- Home: This is the landing page where you can be redirected to create your account or to signup as a vet in the platform

- FindVets: In this page you can find the vets signed up in the platform and you can filter them by specialty, usign the radio button on top. Because of some bugs you need to choose the specialty and then click on ShowAll to do another search, if you search two times in a row without showing all vets it will not find anything.
- MakeAppointment: This has a simple form to create the appointment with the selected vet, in here you have to click all the fields in order to make the form otherwise it will not create the appointment.
- Profile: This is the main part of the app, here is where the client can create, edit or delete pets, appointment and its profile information. In here is where you can see all the current appointment created and all the pets that you have.

This site is to meant help vets earn some extra money. This app has 3 CRUDS for each model of mongoose, the way it works is that 
you create a pet in the profile after making your account and then find a vet and make an appointmetn. 

In this app there is no admin user and only the views of the client and does not have the view of the veterinarian, but in a future is meant ot have it.
